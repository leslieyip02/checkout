# Checkout

This project is a payment checkout system. The `scanner` module scans product barcodes and the `screen` module will generate and display a PayNow QR code.

Specifically, this project is meant for the [RC4](https://rc4.nus.edu.sg/) SOS Corner, which is a student-run snack bar.

Pictures coming soon!
